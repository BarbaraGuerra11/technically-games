# technically-games
Collection of (simple, reliant on pseudo-graphics) games I've made on python.

Game List:

matemagica_grade: Create non grids, swap its lines or columns and choose n numbers from it (never from the same line or column). The sum depends only on n.

hanoi_tower: move all the disks from the first base to the last

jogo_do_nimV1: jogo do nim, line version

jogo_do_nimV2: jogo do nem, pyramid version

cara_a_cara_matematico: classic guess who game, with numbers

jogos_matematicos: unified interface for nim v1, nim v2 and cara a cara.
